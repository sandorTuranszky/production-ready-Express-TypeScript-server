This is an [Express.js](https://github.com/Automattic/kue) based Nodejs server that implements production-ready error handling and logging following latest best practices.

This project is inspired by an idea to quickly create a production ready project with all the required infrastructure at low cost yet with important security measures in place and ability to quickly scale in order to ship a quality product to early adopters. Ideal for quickly starting an app to validate ideas and scale if needed.

One of the main points is that we do not need to deal with setting up servers or databases to validate an idea. Therefore, this opensource project relies on cloud solutions for managing DBs, deployments, sending transactional emails, which have free plans with useful and secure features. And you can always switch to a paid plan if your projects grow fast and you need more power.

Current stack is JavaScript/Nodejs, MongoDB, Redis, Graphql. [Now](https://zeit.co/now) for deployment.

## Features

- Logging with Morgan and Winston
- Application Configuration with <a href="https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config" target="_blank">node-config</a>
- Linting
- Testing with Jets and Supertest
- MongodDb support with Mongoose `v1.1.0`
- Redis support `v1.2.0`

## Set up environment variables

Rename `*.sample.js` files in `/server/config` directory:

- `default.sample.js -> default.js`
- `production.sample.js -> production.js`
- `test.sample.js -> test.js`

Create `.env` file in the root of the project with the following lines:

```
//.env

MONGO_DB=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0-clxgl.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PRISMA_URL=http://localhost:4466
NGINX_PORT=3045 // or whatever you want

```

More details on how config works see [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config).

## Install and start Docker

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (if not yet installed) and make sure it runs
- Run `docker-compose up`

## Install npm dependencies

- Run `npm install`

## Create account and connect to MongoDB Atlas cloud instance using the FREE plan

- Create an account with [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/pricing) using the FREE plan and follow instructions [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/)

## Set up Prisma

1. Prisma serves as an ORM. Run `npm i -g prisma` to install it
2. Schema is defined here `./prisma/datamodel.prisma`
3. Run `prisma deploy` or `(npm run deploy)`

- Later, during development, use `npm run get-schema` to download schema from endpoint to `./src/generated/prisma.graphql`. Note that it will run automatically on `prisma deploy` or `(npm run deploy)` as it is set up in `post-deploy` hook in `/prisma/prisma.yml`
- Prisma GraphQl playground is available here `http://localhost:4466`
- Apollo server GraphQl playground - `http://localhost:${NGINX_PORT}/graphql`

## Create account and connect to RedisLabs cloud instance using the FREE plan

- Create an account with [Redislabs](https://redislabs.com/get-started/) using the FREE plan (choose Cloud Hosted - free up to 30MB) and follow instructions [here](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rc/quick-setup-redis-cloud/)

!!!Note!!! the redis url looks as follows (the part after `@` is the Endpoint from the dashboard configuration tab):

```
redis://:<password>@redis-<...>.cloud.redislabs.com:<port>
```

## Create account and setup Sentry error tracking

- Create a Sentry account [here](https://sentry.io/welcome/)
- Add `your-sentry-dsn` to all configuration files in `/config` dir

```
  sentry: {
    dsn: 'your-sentry-dsn',
  },
```

## Create account and setup MailJet to send transactional emails

- Create a MailJet account [here](https://www.mailjet.com/)
- Add `your-mailjet-api-key` and `your-mailjet-secret` to all configuration files in `/config` dir

```
  mailjet: {
    api_key: 'your-mailjet-api-key',
    secret: 'your-mailjet-secret',
  },
```

- Important!!! You need to use a domain-based email address as an email sender (e.g. your project's domain name) to ensure emails are delivered to the inbox. Otherwise, they will end up in spam (including example@gmail.com once). In your MailJet account you can verify your email and take additional measures (e.g.SPF and DKIM settings) to ensure your emails are delivered.

## Kue UI dashboard

- The dashboard is available under `http://localhost:3050/active` or via nginx `http://localhost:${NGINX_PORT}/kue/active`

## Run server

- `npm run dev` - development mode or
- `npm run start` - production mode
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f test-env.yml up` - run server in test environment

## Testing and linting

- `npm run test:unit` - run unit tests
- `npm run test:int` - run integration tests
- `npm run coverage` - test coverage
- `npm run lint` - lint

## Making changes to Graphql schemas

- update/add data model `/prisma/datamodel.prisma`
- update/add schema `/src/graphql/schema.graphql`
- update/add queries, mutations or subscriptions `/src/graphql/resolvers/`
- run `npm run deploy` to update prisma data model and generate schema in `/generated`

## Test error handling

- navigate to `/api/crash/` and click on any of the listed options

  Note, that crash routes for testing error handling are not available in `production` env

## Error handling implementation explained

- [Error handling Wiki](https://github.com/sandorTuranszky/production-ready-ExpressJs-server/wiki/Error-handling)

## Closing prisma to the outside world

- Add your secret in `prisma/prisma.yml`

```
secret: putYourSuperSecretTextHere

```

- Add the same secret in `src/db/prisma.js`

```
secret: 'putYourSuperSecretTextHere',

```

- run `npm run deploy`

Now the `http://localhost:${NGINX_PORT}/graphql` endpoint will work as expected.

However the `http://localhost:4466` will return `"Your token is invalid"` error. To be able to use it, you need to generate an authorization token and use it in HTTP headers. Here is how you do it:

- run `npm run get-prisma-token`
- copy the generated token
- insert the following HTTP headers (bottom left corner) in graphql playground under `http://localhost:4466`

```
{
  "Authorization":"Bearer 'generated token'" // mind the space between "Bearer" and the token
}
```

## Pushing images to docker hub

To push images to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) you need to provide your Docker user name and password as environment variables.
Refer to [Travis documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings) for more details

Once environment variables set, uncomment related lines in `.travis.yml` file
